                <h4>   
                    As a systems engineering student, I have cultivated a strong foundation in software development, with a focus on frontend technologies. My experience in crafting intuitive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap has equipped me with the skills to create engaging web experiences. While my expertise predominantly lies in frontend development, I am eager to expand my horizons and deepen my knowledge of backend technologies. With a desire to delve into backend systems utilizing Node.js, Express, and databases such as MySQL and MongoDB, I am committed to continuous learning and growth. By leveraging my existing frontend skills and embracing new challenges in backend development, I am poised to create comprehensive and innovative solutions that bridge the gap between frontend and backend realms.
